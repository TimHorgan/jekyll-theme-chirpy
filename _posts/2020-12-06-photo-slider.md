## Images

By default, the image is centered and the image caption can be displayed at the bottom:


![Desktop View](/assets/images/gallery-0/image1.jpg)
_Full screen width and centre alignment_

You can change the size of the picture:

![Desktop View](/assets/images/gallery-0/image1.jpg){: width="400"}
_400px image width_

In addition, you can use class `normal` , `left` and `right` to specify the image position (but in these case, the image caption is prohibited), for example:

- Normal position

  ![Desktop View](/assets/images/gallery-0/image1.jpg){: width="350" class="normal"}

- Float to the left

  ![Desktop View](/assets/images/gallery-0/image1.jpg){: width="240" class="left"}
